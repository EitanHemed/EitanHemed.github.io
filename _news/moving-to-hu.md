Officially started my position at Humboldt University of Berlin, for a postdoctoral fellowship with
Prof. Marcel Brass. Excited to be part of the [Social Intelligence lab](https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/), 
as a fellow of the [Science of Intelligence](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/people/eitan-hemed/) cluster.
