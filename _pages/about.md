**Current position**

I am a postdoctoral researcher with [Prof. Marcel Brass](https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/) at Humboldt 
University of Berlin, and a fellow of the [Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/). 
Currently, I am working on observational learning reinforcement learning - i.e., how we 
learn to maximize rewards from the actions and outcomes of others.

----------------

**In the past**

In my previous postdoctoral research I led attempt to study how infants learn to move voluntarily, mainly through studying 
early reaching behavior (currently still undergoing). To do so we used pose-estimation methods to track infants' 
movements from videos captured during free play (e.g., [this poster](https://github.com/EitanHemed/Poster-Behavioral-Data-Science-Symposium-Technion-2023)).
In this project I continued to collaborate with my PhD mentor [Prof. Baruch Eitam](https://www.eitamlab.org/home), and also work with
[Prof. Hagit Hel-Or](https://chb.hevra.haifa.ac.il/) and [Dr. Sagi Jaffe-Dax](https://www.jaffedax.sites.tau.ac.il/). In this position I was a 
postdoctoral fellow of the [Data Science Research Center](https://dsrc.haifa.ac.il) at the University of Haifa.  



In my PhD studies, I was mentored by [Prof. Baruch Eitam](https://www.eitamlab.org/home). I used behavioral experiments 
to test how different statistical properties of action-effect 
feedback reinforce independent levels of action-selection (e.g., [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-022-06345-3)).
