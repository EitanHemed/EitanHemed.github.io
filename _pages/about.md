I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Psychology department at the University of Haifa, interested in how humans learn 
to move and control their motor actions. 

I am fellow of the [Data Science Research Center](https://dsrc.haifa.ac.il) at the University of Haifa.  




----------------

**Research themes**

I used behavioral experiments to test how different statistical properties of action-effect 
feedback reinforce independent levels of action-selection (e.g., [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-022-06345-3)).
I was mentored by [Prof. Baruch Eitam](https://www.eitamlab.org/home).

In my current, postdoctoral research i am leading an attempt to study how infants learn to move voluntarily, mainly through studying 
early reaching behavior. To do so i am using pose-estimation methods to track infants' movements from videos captured 
during free play (e.g., [this poster](https://github.com/EitanHemed/Poster-Behavioral-Data-Science-Symposium-Technion-2023)).
In this project i continue to collaborate with [Prof. Baruch Eitam](https://www.eitamlab.org/home), and also work with
[Prof. Hagit Hel-Or](https://chb.hevra.haifa.ac.il/) and [Dr. Sagi Jaffe-Dax](https://www.jaffedax.sites.tau.ac.il/).
